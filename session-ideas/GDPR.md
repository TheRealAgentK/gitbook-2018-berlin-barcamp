# GDPR: The Aftermath Experiences

GDPR went into effect on May 25th 2018 and is the first ever piece of European wide Data Privacy legislation.

As GDPR carries expensive penalties for non-compliance, companies have rushed to implement them 
but in a non-consistent way as the community hasn't found yet a common ground.

In this session, we invite all participants to share what them and their teams have done to adopt GDPR on their apps.

- Did you handle user consent for ads, tracking or crash reporting?
- Did you have a personal project that has been affected by GDPR?
- What's the aftermath of the application in your product?
- How did it affect your product launch?
- What tools did you use for that effect?
- What tools did you have to stop using due to new restrictions?

This will be an open microphone session, everyone is free to participate and share!
