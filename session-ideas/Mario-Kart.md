# Androids Play Mario Kart Together

Bring your Nintendo Switch + Mario Kart 8 to Berlin!

We are a group of Android developers who plays together Mario Kart on weekly basis.
We would like to invite all Mario Kart players to join us on a tournament session during Droidcon's Interactive Day!

*Details will come soon, but don't forget to pack your console :D*
