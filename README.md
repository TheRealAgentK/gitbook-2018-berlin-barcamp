# Day One at Droidcon Berlin 2018

The first day of [Droidcon Berlin](http://droidcon.de) is traditionally an interactive day. In previous years it was a full day [barcamp](http://barcamp.org).

To make the day more sustainable, this booklet contains summaries, links, and resources about the sessions.

Thank you to all contributors! See the list at [Github](https://github.com/droidcon/gitbook-2018-berlin-barcamp/network/members).
